  <p> -- —- Student Comments, Computational Probability and Statistics (Fall 2014) <br>
  <p> He’s great, always super helpful and held great hours despite the highly stressed students that would come. </p>
  
  <p>He was always happy to answer both conceptual and practical questions in office hours. One of his best characteristics as a teacher is that he didn’t just explain—-he helped lead people to discover the answers themselves (which creates a better understanding of the material). Sometimes he gave some confusing advice about implementing the problem sets though. That said, he knew a lot, was a good teacher, and went beyond the call of duty, staying late to help answer questions.</p>

  <p>I only made it to Jake’s hours once, but he was available and clear that one time. </p>

  <p>Effective on canvas.</p>

  <p>Only had online contact, but very responsive every time. Quick and elaborate.</p>

  <p>Very helpful in answering hw questions.</p>

  <p>Great!</p>

  <p>Almost all the questions put on canvas were answered appropriately by the T.A.</p>

  <p>I only went to Jake’s hours once, but he helped to talk us through our problems without just telling us the answers. </p>

  <p>I did not interact with this TA. Overall, I was not satisfied with the speed with which the homework were returned graded. </p>

  <p>Did not interact much, but great impression!</p>

  <p>Had trouble staying on topic during review sessions.</p>

  <p>Responses on Piazza is informative and quick. </p>

  <p>TA hours were very helpful.</p>

  <p>Was open to help me. Clarified many questions online.</p>

  <p>It will be great to start reviewing concepts from class, at the beginning. Because I found what is explained in class are more general. When trying to solve homework. Once get the clue, it is easier. Thank you for all the help.</p>
  
  <p>Good, though grading could have been faster.</p>

  <p>TA hours run by Jake were very helpful in that he discussed a lot about the material covered in class. He was very nice and it was easy to ask questions.</p>
  
  <p>I often came into TA hours with a vague idea of how to approach a problem, and Jake helped explain the concepts to me clearly. I appreciated it.</p>
  
  <p>I wish homework was graded faster; he was very good in office hours. </p>
  
  <p>Jake was very welcoming.</p>

  <p>Always present at class. Willing to help. </p>

  <p>Very patient and helpful.</p>

  <p>Jake was helpful in office hours primarily through his ability to come up with examples/counterexamples to show points relating to concepts on the homework or from class.</p>
