  <b>Jake Soloff</b>
  <p> </p>
  <p> I am a first year PhD student in the Statistics department at UC Berkeley. Previously, I received an ScB in mathematics at Brown University, where I worked with Professor Erik Sudderth and Mike Hughes on Bayesian nonparametric modeling for speaker diarization. I like working on applied and theoretical problems at the same time. My research goal is to develop statistical methods for scalable machine learning, motivated by applications in cognitive biology and behavioral analysis. I have previously worked on topic modeling for article recommendations, crop monitoring with remotely sensed data, and gesture recognition from kinect data. Here is a link to <a href="Soloff.pdf">my CV</a>. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> Hobbies include biking, playing music, origami, and (recently) defeating <a href="http://projecteuler.net/profile/jaketheogre.png">project euler</a>. </p>
