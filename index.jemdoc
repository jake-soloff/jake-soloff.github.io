== About Me

[img{202}{188} jake.jpg]

I am a PhD candidate in the [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Department of Statistics] at 
UC Berkeley, co-advised by [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aditya/index.html Aditya Guntuboyina] 
and [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/ Michael I. Jordan]. Previously, I received an ScB in mathematics at Brown University.

My current research relates to shape constrained estimation in a variety of contexts, including
high-dimensional statistics and nonparametric empirical Bayes.
