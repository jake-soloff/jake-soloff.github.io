--Student Comments, Principles and Techniques of Data Science (Fall 2017) 

Awesome TA. One of the best I've ever had. 

This TA goes in depth into the math behind the things we are learning, which is very refreshing. He can seem a bit bored at times, but that's about it.

I didnt go for discussion much but i did go for his office hours and he was super helpful 

Very helpful and explains things really well!

He's good at explaining and incorporating visuals in his explanations!

Yes, it explains concepts well.

No, unprepared (first 4 sections). Didn't attend after that.

Also helpful, answers questions thoroughly, teaches section even with just one student

Jake is very open to students' questions and does a great job explaining the concepts. He is very patient with his students and does a good job relating.

he doesn't seem that into what he's teaching and doesn't explain thoroughly

Always helpful when answering questions.

Yes. I've like how knowledgable he is, and how answered my questions to my intuition. Sometimes goes on tangents, that are hard to follow.

Yes helpful. Answers questions well. 

He was very knowledgeable and smart.

He was helpful anytime students had questions. I mostly had debugging issues not conceptual issues in lab.

Yup, he has been helpful

Yes. He helped as much as he could.

Omg Jake was such a gem <3. Really great guy who was ready to help.

He answers questions well.

Jake was very helpful in lab, I liked the fact that he was willing to answer all questions and stayed back to do so sometimes. One thing he could improve on is giving a more introductory announcement at the start of lab.

Yes, this TA has been helpful during lab. He doesn't mind helping people on homework and projects instead of lab. He is very chill.

He is chill and helpful.

Very helpful, always answers questions with a good attitude and explains concepts on whiteboard

He has been very helpful. Knowledgeable and responsive. 

Generally, he's quiet but helpful

He was very busy during lab, and when I did ask questions he was not as helpful as I wanted. 

First section was with Jake (review of linear algebra and coding topics) and it was really confusing... nothing against Jake because his mini-presentation in class was interesting and easy to understand.

I have had GREAT interactions with Jake.

I liked lab with Jake, he was always able to explain concepts when necessary and his lab was low stress.

I left Jake's lab section because it didn't really seem like he cared.

I've had GREAT interactions with Jake and Joey. Jake helped me in lab a couple of times to walk through concepts and was really awesome to parse through the material with. Joey is one of the nicest instructors I've ever had and is really approachable.

Jake is one of the best TAâs Ive ever had. He was so easy to talk to. Was super helpful in answering all questions. 

Jake!!!

Because of some of the questions I've asked Jake, I did really well in the class and midterm!

Jake was very helpful during his Office hours
